## ðŸ“¹ VIDEO 1: "3 AI Tools That Actually Work for Research"

### Script Breakdown

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
*"Okay, everyone's talking about AI in research, but most of it is either hype or panic."*

**Main Content (3-25 seconds):**
*"Here's what actually works.*

*First - Otter.ai for transcription. Yeah, it's about 85% accurate, but that still saves you hours. Just don't trust it for analysis without checking.*

*Second - Semantic Scholar. This isn't some random AI - it's built for academics. Finds papers you'd never discover otherwise and maps citation networks.*

*Third - ChatGPT for writing feedback. Not for writing your paper, but for spotting unclear sentences and suggesting better phrasing. Huge difference."*

**CTA (25-30 seconds):**
*"The key? Use AI for the tedious stuff so you can focus on the thinking. Link in bio for the full reality check guide."*

### Visual Production Notes
- **Layout:** Split screen - tool interfaces left, benefits text right
- **Text Overlays:** "ACTUALLY WORKS" in bold at start
- **Graphics:** Tool logos appear as mentioned (Otter.ai, Semantic Scholar, ChatGPT)
- **Transitions:** Quick cuts between tools with smooth animations
- **End Screen:** "More tools that don't suck â†’ [website link]"
- **Colors:** Professional blues/greens, avoid academic boring

### Voice Direction
- **Tone:** Confident but conversational, like talking to a smart colleague
- **Pacing:** Steady but not rushed, pause after each tool for emphasis
- **Emphasis:** Stress "actually works," "85% accurate," "huge difference"
- **Energy:** Medium-high, engaged but not hyperactive

## ðŸ“¹ VIDEO 2: "Survey Design With AI - What Could Go Wrong"

### Script Breakdown

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
*"Using AI for survey design? Here's how people mess it up."*

**Main Content (3-25 seconds):**
*"Mistake one - asking AI to write questions without context. You get generic garbage like 'How satisfied are you with our excellent service?' That's a leading question.*

*Mistake two - not checking for bias. AI loves double-barreled questions: 'How do you feel about the quality and price?' Pick one thing.*

*Mistake three - forgetting cultural assumptions. AI will write 'How does your spouse feel...' Not everyone has a spouse."*

**CTA (25-30 seconds):**
*"Here's what works: Give AI your research context, ask for multiple variations, then validate everything. AI suggests, humans decide. Full checklist at the link."*

### Visual Production Notes
- **Layout:** Bad examples with big red X's, good examples with green checkmarks
- **Text Overlays:** "SURVEY FAILS" transitioning to "DO THIS INSTEAD"
- **Graphics:** Survey question mockups, animated X's and checkmarks
- **Examples:** Show actual bad vs. good question text
- **End Screen:** "Avoid disasters â†’ [checklist link]"
- **Colors:** Red for mistakes, green for solutions

### Voice Direction
- **Tone:** Slightly exasperated but helpful, like preventing a friend from making mistakes
- **Pacing:** Deliberate on the "mistakes," quicker on solutions
- **Emphasis:** Stress "garbage," "pick one thing," "humans decide"
- **Energy:** Building urgency then resolving with confidence

## ðŸ“¹ VIDEO 3: "How to Disclose AI Use Without Sounding Sketchy"

### Script Breakdown

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
*"Your advisor says disclose AI use, but how do you do it without sounding like you cheated?"*

**Main Content (3-25 seconds):**
*"Bad: 'AI tools were used in this study.' Vague and suspicious.*

*Good: 'ChatGPT-4 was used to generate initial survey question variations, which were then validated by the research team using established methodology principles.'*

*Be specific about what AI did, what it didn't do, and how you validated everything. IRBs want transparency, not mystery."*

**CTA (25-30 seconds):**
*"The trick? Show AI enhanced your process, didn't replace your thinking. You're still the researcher. Ready-to-copy templates at the link."*

### Visual Production Notes
- **Layout:** Document mockups with highlighted sections
- **Text Overlays:** "SKETCHY" vs "TRANSPARENT" split screen
- **Graphics:** Academic paper templates, highlighted disclosure text
- **Transitions:** Bad example fading out, good example fading in
- **End Screen:** "Copy templates â†’ [ethics template link]"
- **Colors:** Professional academic styling, avoid looking too corporate

### Voice Direction
- **Tone:** Reassuring but authoritative, like an experienced mentor
- **Pacing:** Slower on the "bad" example, confident on the "good" example
- **Emphasis:** Stress "vague and suspicious," "transparency," "still the researcher"
- **Energy:** Calm confidence, building trust

## ðŸ“¹ VIDEO 4: "Mixed Methods Researchers - AI Is Your Secret Weapon"

### Script Breakdown

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
*"Mixed methods researchers, AI can solve your biggest headache."*

**Main Content (3-25 seconds):**
*"You know that awkward transition between your quantitative and qualitative phases? Where you're staring at survey results wondering what to ask in interviews?*

*AI can bridge that gap. Feed it your statistical findings and ask for interview question suggestions. Not to replace your expertise, but to spark ideas you might miss.*

*It's also great for spotting patterns across data types. AI flags potential connections, you decide if they're meaningful."*

**CTA (25-30 seconds):**
*"The key? Use triangulation to validate AI insights. Mixed methods was built for this kind of verification. Full guide at the link. Your dissertation timeline will thank you."*

### Visual Production Notes
- **Layout:** Workflow diagram showing Quantitative â†’ AI Bridge â†’ Qualitative
- **Text Overlays:** "SECRET WEAPON" prominently displayed
- **Graphics:** Split screen showing data integration, arrows connecting phases
- **Animation:** Flow from numbers to AI to interview questions
- **End Screen:** "Master MM + AI â†’ [mixed methods guide link]"
- **Colors:** Dynamic flow between data types, professional but energetic

### Voice Direction
- **Tone:** Excited but knowledgeable, like sharing a game-changing discovery
- **Pacing:** Building excitement, pause at "biggest headache" for relatability
- **Emphasis:** Stress "secret weapon," "bridge that gap," "dissertation timeline"
- **Energy:** High enthusiasm while maintaining credibility

## ðŸ“¹ VIDEO 5: "AI Bias Detection - Easier Than You Think"

### Script Breakdown

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
*"Everyone's worried about AI bias, but most people don't know how to actually check for it."*

**Main Content (3-25 seconds):**
*"Simple test: Ask AI the same question multiple ways and see if you get consistent answers. If it's all over the place, dig deeper.*

*Look for cultural assumptions. If AI suggests questions about 'traditional families' or 'normal work schedules,' red flag.*

*Check who's represented. AI trained on mostly Western, white, male perspectives? Your research might miss entire populations."*

**CTA (25-30 seconds):**
*"The fix isn't avoiding AI - it's being smart about validation. Reality check: AI bias is real, but so is human bias. At least with AI, you can test for it systematically. Full strategies at the link."*

### Visual Production Notes
- **Layout:** Examples with bias highlighted in red warning boxes
- **Text Overlays:** "BIAS DETECTED" warnings, "TEST FOR THIS"
- **Graphics:** Before/after examples, cultural assumption callouts
- **Animation:** Red flags appearing over problematic text
- **End Screen:** "Detect bias like a pro â†’ [reality check guide link]"
- **Colors:** Warning reds for bias, calming blues for solutions

### Voice Direction
- **Tone:** Matter-of-fact but not alarmist, like a practical problem-solver
- **Pacing:** Steady throughout, pause for emphasis on "red flag"
- **Emphasis:** Stress "simple test," "red flag," "systematically"
- **Energy:** Calm confidence, addressing concerns without fear-mongering
